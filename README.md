     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     node app.js
     ```
   - The backend will run on port 3000 by default.

3. **Frontend Setup**:  
   - Provide your **FINNHUB_API_KEY** and **ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY** in `frontend/src/config.js`.
  
   - Navigate to the `/frontend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the frontend:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - The frontend will run on port 3002 by default.

5. **API Keys**:

     - **Finnhub API**: [https://finnhub.io/dashboard](https://finnhub.io/dashboard)
     - **Alpha Vantage API**: [https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)
   - Add these keys to your `frontend/src/config.js` file to enable real-time financial data fetching.
